## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Context Api for UI State Management
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used styled-components for this project. Using props in styled-components sometimes get complex. This was my first time arranging a sites components based on mobile design using styled-components.

### Continued development

Mobile design can be improved. Email and phone errors can be added so we could let our users know that their email and phone numbers are not up to the standard.

### Useful resources

- [Styled Components Best Practices](https://www.robinwieruch.de/styled-components/) - I didn't fully read this article but used it make sure, I am using correct styled-components file structure and component design patterns.
